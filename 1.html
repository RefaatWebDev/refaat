    <h1> C++ </h1>
    <P> C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language widely used for building system software, game engines,
        and applications that require fast execution and efficient memory management. It supports both procedural and
        object-oriented programming, giving developers the flexibility to organize and structure their code effectively.
        With features like classes, inheritance, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL), C++ allows
        programmers to create complex and optimized programs. Its speed and control make it a popular choice in fields
        such as robotics, embedded systems, and real-time applications.</P>
